This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: incorrect usage of string matching when counting occurrences of a pattern. The `bug.tcl` file contains code that uses `string match` to count pattern occurrences, which is flawed. The correct approach using regular expressions is shown in the `bugSolution.tcl` file.  The problem arises because `string match` only performs a simple prefix match, not a full pattern match.  This example highlights the need for careful selection of string manipulation functions based on the desired pattern matching behavior.
